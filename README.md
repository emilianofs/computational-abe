## Agent Based Economics Model Simulator

###What is an ABM?

Agent Based Models (ABMs) for an economic system take advantage of the huge increase in computational power we've seen recent years, and emerges as a response to many flaws of mainstream or neoclassical models.
ABMs rely on letting a multiplicity of agents (representing households, firms, or banks, for example) to interact with each other and make decisions according to certain rules, hence letting the macro evolution of the system emerge from micro fundations.
These models are interesting when studying complex systems, network dynamics and micro-macro interactions in the economy.

### Why use java?
ABMs are especially suitable for object oriented paradigms as agents can be instantiations of different classes and their methods describe the scope of their actions.

### What is this project about?
In this case, we build up an implementation of an ABM where Keynesian (demand led) processes as well as Schumpeterian-like technological improvement fuel output growth.
The simulation will generate the agents, and let the system evolve, while computing a set of variables of interest (total output, growth, unemployment, inflation, productivity, etc etc)
For detailed description, and a review of this simulation in action, you can check this [document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hxfqmrtktwhp).
